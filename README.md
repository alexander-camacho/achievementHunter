# WoW Random Achievement Hunter

As a World of Warcraft player who loves hunting achievements, I want to continue completing achievements but am unsure where to start.

I want an app that will recommend me a random achievement to complete next, from my incomplete achievements.

Then I will be presented with an achievement, with some of the basic information about it, and the option to random again if I donâ€™t like the chosen achievement.
## Planned Features

Allow a user to search by character, then use a random button to recommend an incomplete achievement.(Option to generate random by category?)

When the random achievement is displayed, have a clickable WoWHead link, where the user can find more information about the achievement.

Allow the user to login, grabbing the data for their character.

Allow the user to save a wishlist of achievements that they are hunting, if they want to pursue multiple simultaneously.

Allow the user to search multiple characters together for random achievements that are incomplete  on all characters, useful for groups.


## Technology

Use WoW Profile Data -> Character Achievement API, WoW Game Data -> Realm API,
